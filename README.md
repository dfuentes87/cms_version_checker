# cms_version_checker

I created this Bash script to learn, practice, and hone my Bash scripting skill. I used to use it at work in order quickly find any installed WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Magento, phpBB, Moodle, and Opencart CMS on the server I am on. Each installation found will then have its version compared against the latest official version and if it is out of date the path and version installed will be output to be reviewed.

Anyone is welcome to fork the script and improve on it, or if you want to use it do so at your own risk.
