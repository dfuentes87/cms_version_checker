# cms_version_checker

I created this Bash script to learn, practice, and hone my Bash scripting skill. I use at work in order quickly find any installed WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and phpBB CMS on the server I was on. Each installation found will then have its version compared against the latest official version and if it was out of date it would be output for me to review.

Anyone is welcome to fork the script and improve on it, or if you want to use it do so at your own risk.
